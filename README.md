Just another repository

Name: Tyler Ingham
Current Position: Full tiem student at Missouri University of Science and Technology

I am an aspiring developer at MS&T enrolled in a bachelor of arts program in computer science. I will be periodically adding new/old/updated projects I do/have done in my free time as well as projects from my classes I feel are interesting enough to share. For those who care, I am expected to graduate in the spring of 2018. Puropose of this repository is to share as well as keep a record of my projects as a way to see improvements in technique and general knowledge. Favorite languages are: C++, Java, C#, and Python.
